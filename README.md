# Web-scraping-API
Web scraping using the website's API
In this project, I scraped the website [Truecar.com](https://www.truecar.com/) to extract the data for the used cars in California and New York for about 340 pages. 
Each page had 30 records. Afterwards, I connected this data to PostgreSQL to enable further analysis using SQL.
Following data was extracted:
 1. Brand of the car
 2. Model of the car
 3. Mileage of the car
 4. Year when the car was bought
 5. Price in US$
